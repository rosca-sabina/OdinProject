    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <!--<a> (the anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses,
        locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
        Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination.-->
    <div>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click me!</a>
    </div>

    <!--The target attribute determines here to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>).
        The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:
            _self: the current browsing context. (Default)
            _blank: usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
            _parent: the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
            _top: the topmost browsing context (the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one). If no ancestors, behaves as _self.-->
    <!--The rel attribute is used to describe the relationship between the current page and the linked document.-->
    <!--noopener instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting the new browsing context
        access to the document that opened it — by not setting the Window.opener property on the opened window (it returns null).
        This is especially useful when opening untrusted links, in order to ensure they cannot tamper with the originating document
        via the Window.opener property.-->
    <!--noreferrer instructs the browser, when navigating to the target resource, to omit the Referer header and otherwise leak no
        referrer information — and additionally to behave as if the noopener keyword were also specified -->
    <div>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Open me in a new tab safely!</a>
    </div>

    <!--Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
        A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path.
        An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.-->
    <div>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">I'm an absolute link!</a>
    </div>

    <!--Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
        Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site,
        it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
        They only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.-->
    <!--. means the current directory.
        .. means the directory above the current directory. .. can be chained (../../etc) to go further levels above.-->
    <div>
        <a href="./pages/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm a relative link!</a>
    </div>

    <!--<img> embeds an image into the document. The src attribute defines the image URL.
        <img> is a self-closing HTML element.-->
    <!--alt provides fallback (alternate) text to display when the image specified by the <img> element is not loaded.
        alt is also important for accessibility; screen-readers use it do describe the image out loud for the user.-->
