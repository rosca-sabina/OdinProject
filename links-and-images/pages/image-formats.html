    <!--JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.
        This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. 
        However, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels.-->
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>

    <!--GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations.
        However, they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette, so never use them for photos.
        Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels.
        This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background.-->

    <!--PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated.
        For photos, a PNG file of the same quality would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.
        However, PNGs deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations.
        This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.-->

    <!--Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format,
        meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.
        This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design.
        However, if the image contains a lot of text, this can have an impact on SVG file size.-->
