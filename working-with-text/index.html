    <!--Headings are block-level elements (they start on a new line and take up all of the width of their containing block).-->
    <!--A document should not contain multiple h1 headings.-->
    <!--You shouldn't skip levels when adding headings to your page.-->
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <!--Paragraphs (<p>) are also block-level elements.-->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <!--<strong> is used to semantically mark text as important (which is important for tools like screen readers).
        Strong elements will be rendered in bold.
        <strong> is an inline element (they do not start on a new line and only take as up as much space in their
        containing block as their content requires).-->
    <p>This is <strong>important</strong> stuff.</p>

    <!--<b> defines bold text, without marking it as semantically important.
        <b> is an inline element.-->
    <p>This is <b>bold</b> stuff, but it's not semantically important.</p>

    <!--<em> semantically places emphasis on its content. Em (which stands for EMphasis) is rendered as italic.
        <em> is an inline element.-->
    <p>This is <em>emphasized</em> stuff.</p>

    <!--<i> defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically rendered in italic.
        <i> is an inline element.-->
    <p>This is <i>a thought in an alternate mood</i> than the rest of the content.</p>

    <p>This text is <small>small</small>.</p>
    <p>This text is <mark>highlighted</mark>.</p>
    <p>This text is <del>deleted</del>.</p>
    <p>This text is <ins>inserted</ins>.</p>
    <p>You can use the previous two together to make a <del>deeznuts</del> <ins>diff</ins>.</p>
    <p>This is <sub>subscript</sub> text. This is <sup>superscript</sup> text. You can do math with them: x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = x<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>.</p>

    <!--Nesting terminology-->
    <p> <!--Parent element-->
        <p></p> <!--Child element-->

        <!--Sibiling element, because:
                - They/re children of the same parent element.
                - They're on the same level of nesting.-->
